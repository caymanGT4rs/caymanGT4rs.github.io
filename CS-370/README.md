"Current Emerging Trends in CS - 2024"

For this project, I implemented Deep Q-Learning into an half provided code for an AI "Pirate Intelligent Agent" to solve a maze and get to the treasure.

Prompted Questions From CS-370:
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer Scientists find solutions to probelms that can be solved through programs created by the computer scientist. This matters because of how much of everyones lives are dependent on computers wheter it be for communication or for solving porblems for a company.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  As a Computer Scientist, I approach a problem with the simplest solution between the problem and where I want the problem to go. The simplest soltuion is almost always the best especially for a sytem that requires multiple different areas working together to solve that problem.
  After planning around the simplest solution, I have a guideline that I can follow whether I am devloping alone or alongside a team where I can delgate parts of the system to others.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization to keep the users information safe from breaches and establishing trust with the user by only prompting for the necessary and minimum amount of information.
