I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by testing all requirements the client gives to me and by making sure that the code completes those requirements efficiently.
I interpret user and client needs by asking what they want their system to do. From this I am able to clarify with them in non-technical wording where I have an understanding of what their system needs to do. With the requirements written, I can reference them while writing code and testing to make sure the code operates and follows those guidelines.
I approach designing software by using the requirements from the user as the guidelines to creating their system. From there, I can create diagrams to develope the vision for that code and system, and use this alongside the requirements to create a functional system.
