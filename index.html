            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Cayman Casteel and I am currently a student at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) graduating March of 2025.</p>
        </section>
         <section id="self-assessment">
    <p>Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have developed a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures and algorithms, database management, security, and effective collaboration. My experiences have prepared me to work efficiently in a team environment, communicate with stakeholders, and develop scalable and secure applications.</p>

    <p><strong>Collaborating in a Team Environment:</strong> Successful software development requires strong teamwork and collaboration. Throughout my projects, I have worked in group settings where version control systems like Git facilitated smooth collaboration. I have experience participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback, and ensuring seamless integration of code contributions. These experiences have strengthened my ability to work with diverse teams, adapt to different development methodologies, and contribute to achieving common project goals.</p>

    <p><strong>Communicating with Stakeholders:</strong> Clear and effective communication is essential for bridging the gap between technical and non-technical audiences. I have developed the ability to translate complex technical concepts into understandable terms for stakeholders, ensuring that project requirements align with business goals. Through documentation, presentations, and discussions, I have practiced conveying progress updates, gathering feedback, and refining project scope based on stakeholder input.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> Writing efficient and optimized code is a crucial aspect of software development. I have gained proficiency in various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, stacks, and queues, and have applied them to solve computational problems efficiently. Algorithm optimization, including sorting and searching techniques, has been integral to my approach in developing high-performing applications that handle large datasets effectively.</p>

    <p><strong>Software Engineering and Database Management:</strong> My approach to software engineering is grounded in best practices, including modular design, object-oriented programming, and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I have experience designing and implementing relational databases using SQL while also working with NoSQL solutions for more flexible data storage. Proper indexing, normalization, and query optimization have been key to ensuring data integrity, security, and performance in my projects.</p>

    <p><strong>Security Considerations:</strong> Secure software development is a priority in modern applications. I have applied security best practices such as data encryption, secure authentication mechanisms, and input validation to protect applications from vulnerabilities. Additionally, understanding common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and improper access control has helped me design applications with a strong security foundation.</p>

    <p>This ePortfolio highlights my technical expertise and my ability to work in collaborative environments while addressing key aspects of software development. By combining strong problem-solving skills with effective communication and security awareness, I am well-prepared to take on challenges in the field of computer science and contribute to innovative solutions.</p>
