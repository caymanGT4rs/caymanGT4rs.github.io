            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Cayman Casteel and I am currently a student at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) graduating March of 2025.</p>
        </section>
            <section id="about">
    <h2>My Journey in Computer Science</h2>
    <p>Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I’ve built a strong foundation in software design, algorithms, and database management. This program has given me the opportunity to apply what I’ve learned to real-world applications, helping me sharpen my ability to solve complex problems efficiently.</p>
    
    <h3>Software Development and Engineering</h3>
    <p>One of the biggest areas of growth for me has been applying Software Design and Engineering principles, along with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), to create scalable and maintainable applications. Working with different programming languages, frameworks, and development methodologies has allowed me to build software that is not only functional but also efficient and adaptable.</p>

    <h3>Capstone Project: Inventory Management App</h3>
    <p>A great example of this is my CS 499 Capstone project—an inventory management app that brings together everything I’ve learned. Developing this app challenged me to implement optimized algorithms for data processing, ensuring smooth performance even under heavy loads. It also reinforced my skills in database design and management, as I worked with both SQL and NoSQL technologies to create a secure, reliable system. Seeing this project come together has been incredibly rewarding, and I’m proud of how it showcases my ability to design and develop a well-structured, high-performing application.</p>

    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep growing as a software developer. I’m especially interested in areas like artificial intelligence and virtual environments, where I can contribute to innovative solutions that improve efficiency and user experiences.</p>

    <h3>ePortfolio Overview</h3>
    <p>This ePortfolio is a reflection of my skills, dedication, and passion for computer science. It highlights my technical expertise, the projects I’ve worked on, and my ability to take on new challenges—qualities that make me a strong candidate for future opportunities in the field.</p>
