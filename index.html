    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>    Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have developed a strong foundation in software design, algorithms, and database management. This program has allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world applications, enhancing my ability to solve complex problems efficiently.</p>
    
    <p>One of the key aspects of my growth has been my ability to apply <strong>Software Design and Engineering</strong> principles to create scalable and maintainable applications. I have developed proficiency in various programming languages, frameworks, and development methodologies that ensure efficiency and effectiveness in software projects.</p>
    
    <p>In the area of <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>, I have improved my problem-solving skills by implementing optimized solutions for various computational problems. Understanding how to write efficient code has enabled me to develop applications that perform well even under high computational loads.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, my experience with <strong>Database Design and Management</strong> has provided me with the ability to create, manage, and optimize relational databases using SQL and NoSQL technologies. Through this, I have built robust data-driven applications that emphasize security, integrity, and performance.</p>
    
    <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to continue growing in the field of computer science. I am particularly interested in software development, artificial intelligence, and Virtual Environments. My goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that improve efficiency and user experiences across industries.</p>
    
    <p>This ePortfolio serves as a testament to my skills, dedication, and passion for computer science. It showcases my technical expertise, project work, and ability to adapt to new challenges, all of which make me a strong candidate for future professional opportunities.</p>
