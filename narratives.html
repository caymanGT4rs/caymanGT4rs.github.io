            <h2>Category 1: Software Design & Engineering Enhancements</h2>
            <p>The artifact chosen for the Software Design and Engineering section of my ePortfolio is an Android application I developed for the CS-360 course. This app allows users to create an inventory list tied to their login credentials. Users can add, delete, and modify items within the list. I initially created the application as a proof of concept, and while the basic design and functionality worked, both the code and UI/UX needed refinement.</p>

            <p>I selected this artifact because of its complexity and the opportunity for enhancements that showcase the skills I’ve gained at SNHU. The app’s original code and UI were rough, which gave me room to improve both the user experience (UI/UX) and code quality. I’ve streamlined the registration process by implementing a separate page for user registration, instead of using the same text box for login and registration. This separation clarifies the process for users and adds a layer of security by requiring a matching password during registration.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I added password visibility toggles to both the login and registration pages. This feature helps users verify their password entries, enhancing the overall experience. I also converted the previous “SMS Permissions” button into a “Settings” page, where the new SMS permissions are now managed.</p>

            <p>These changes meet my initial project goals and also contribute to an additional outcome: developing a security mindset that anticipates and mitigates vulnerabilities. I plan to continue enhancing this security aspect.</p>

            <p>In the process, I learned to organize app pages more efficiently to improve user flow, such as moving registration and settings off the main login page. This reduces clutter and improves usability. One challenge I faced was optimizing the code for future scalability. Initially, the code was functional but bloated. By refactoring and using shorter, more efficient code, I was able to maintain readability and keep related functionality together.</p>

            <p>However, I’m still encountering an issue with item persistence. Items are not saved when navigating between pages. This is something I plan to fix in the Data Retrieval phase of the app.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Category 2: Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancements</h2>
            <p>For the Algorithms & Data Structures category, I’ll continue working with the same Android application from the previous section. One major improvement I’m implementing is changing the app’s data structure to improve functionality without sacrificing performance.</p>

            <p>Previously, items were stored in an ArrayList, using a custom `DataItem.java` class with fields like Name, Quantity, and ID. Users could manually input their own item IDs, but feedback indicated that this feature wasn’t necessary for most users. Based on this, I removed the option for custom IDs. Instead, the app now assigns IDs sequentially, which simplifies the process and improves performance.</p>

            <p>I also optimized the way the app manages item IDs by moving the ID generation logic to the `DataDisplayActivity`. This change removed redundant code and improved efficiency.</p>

            <p>These enhancements help meet the course outcomes, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing computing solutions using algorithmic principles and appropriate standards.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating the ability to apply innovative techniques and tools to deliver value and achieve industry-specific goals.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While working on these improvements, I faced challenges, such as implementing sorting functions for the inventory list and ensuring that the Data Display remained responsive. I’m continuing to refine the sorting features, especially ensuring that users can view the list by item ID or quantity without issues.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Category 3: Databases Enhancements</h2>
            <p>In this category, I’m focusing on migrating the app’s data storage from arrays to a SQL database. Currently, the app stores user login credentials in a SQL database, with separate columns for usernames and passwords. The next step is to store inventory items in a new table within the database.</p>

            <p>I created an “inventory” table with columns for Item ID, Name, and Quantity. The next steps involve integrating methods for adding, deleting, and modifying items in the database. Additionally, I need to load data from the database when the app starts, so that the inventory list is populated on the main screen.</p>

            <p>While testing the database enhancements, I encountered an issue with creating the new table. I realized I needed to increment the database version to trigger the `onCreate` method. After adjusting the version number, everything worked as expected.</p>

            <p>These changes support my course outcomes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing computing solutions using algorithms, data structures, and standards.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating innovative techniques in software engineering, design, and database management.</li>
                <li>Developing a security mindset to anticipate and mitigate vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
